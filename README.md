Solar Energy Capstone Project 

Objective: Design a solar power system to meet the energy demands of a designated location.

Skills Demonstrated:

Site Evaluation: Analyzed location factors like solar irradiance and shading to determine solar energy viability.
Energy Consumption Assessment: Calculated the building's energy consumption through load analysis.
Energy Efficiency Optimization: Proposed strategies to reduce the building's energy load.
Solar Array Design: Designed a grid-tied solar photovoltaic (PV) system using commercially available modules to meet the optimized energy needs.
System Sizing and Efficiency: Calculated system size and efficiency based on simplified assumptions learned in the specialization.

Project Scope:
Site Selection: (Specify the type of location - residential building, commercial property, etc.)
Energy Consumption Analysis: (Mention the method used - software, manual calculations, etc.)
Load Reduction Strategies: ( Briefly list the suggested methods to reduce energy consumption)
Solar Array Design: (Specify the type of system - grid-tied, off-grid, etc.)
System Specifications: (Mention the key elements - module type, number of panels, inverter capacity, etc.)

Outcomes:
Demonstrated the ability to apply solar energy principles to real-world scenarios.
Gained experience in designing a complete solar power system.
Developed skills in energy consumption analysis and optimization.
